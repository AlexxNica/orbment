LOLIWM
______

Basic information about what you can currently do in loliwm.

KEYBINDS
--------

+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-return`` | Opens ``weston-terminal``     |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-l``      | Rotates focus through clients |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-k``      | Rotates focus through outputs |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-[1-n]``  | Activate space                |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-h``      | Cycles clients                |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-q``      | Closes focused client         |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| ``mod-esc``    | Quits ``loliwm``              |
+----------------+-------------------------------+

You can change mod with ``--prefix`` argument.  It takes comma ',' separated
list of names:

- shift
- caps
- ctrl
- alt
- mod2
- mod3
- logo
- mod5

KEYBOARD LAYOUT
---------------

You can set your prefered keyboard layout using ``XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT``.

.. code:: sh

    XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=gb loliwm

RUNNING ON TTY
--------------

Running on TTY works right now.
You need to suid the loliwm binary to whichever group or user has rights to /dev/input.
This is so wlc can spawn child process at start that gives rights for libinput to read from these raw input devices.

BUILDING
--------

You will need following makedepends:

- cmake
- git

And the following depends:

- pixman
- wayland (most likely from git)
- libxkbcommon
- udev
- libinput

You will also need these for building, but they are optional runtime:

- libx11
- libxcb
- mesa, nvidia, etc.. (GLESv2, EGL, DRM)

For weston-terminal and other wayland clients for testing, you might also want to build weston from git.

You can build bootstrapped version of ``loliwm`` with the following steps.

.. code:: sh

    git submodule update --init --recursive # - initialize and fetch submodules
    mkdir target && cd target               # - create build target directory
    cmake ..                                # - run CMake
    make                                    # - compile

    # You can now run
    ./src/loliwm

For proper packaging ``wlc`` and ``loliwm`` should be built separately.
Instructions later...
