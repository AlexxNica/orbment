 * sz  | size_t
 * f   | float
 * d   | double
 * c   | char
 * b   | bool
 * e   | enum
 * *   | pointer
 * []  | array, you can use element count inside as C allows compile time checks for element sizes.
 * v   | void
 * fun | function, see function struct above.
 * h   | opaque pod type (wlc_handle, plugin_h, etc...)
 *
 * Written as:
 * <return_type>(<arguments>)|<ABI version>
 *
 * Arguments are separated with colons for readibility.
 *
 * Example:
 * *(c[12],i16,i32)|1
 *
 * Returns pointer, takes char array with size of 12, signed short and signed int.
 * For pointers to POD arrays use [] without number instead of *. eg. char* would be c[].
 * For pointers to POD types use <type>*, eg. size_t* would be sz*.
 *
 * The ABI version must be incremented for each revision of the function where meaning of input data changed.
 * This is most important with pointers used as references to data structures.
 * If the data structure changed, you should raise ABI version.
 *
 * This protects against ABI changes and allows backwards compatibility to some degree.
 *
 * The plugins however most likely will always be compiled with some sort of helper tool and exist in
 * central repository, so ABI breakages should not be common, but still something to think about.
 *
 * Intentional bad plugins can still cause havoc, but these are the tradeoffs for the power of native shared libraries,
 * without using sandboxing and IPC. I think this is not a problem when plugins are available and easily compiled
 * from central repository where bad plugins can be fixed or removed.
 *
 * Of course, it is always good idea to check source of your plugins.
