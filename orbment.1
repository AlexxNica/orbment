new terminal emulator. If this is not set it will fall back on
\fBweston-terminal\fR.
.IP \fBWLC_BG\fR
Takes a boolean \fI0\fR or \fI1\fR which disables or enables the background.
(Default: \fI1\fR)
.IP \fBWLC_SHM\fR
Takes a boolean \fI0\fR or \fI1\fR, true forces EGL clients to fallback to shm.
(Default: \fI0\fR)
.IP \fBWLC_DIM\fR
Takes an interval between \fI0.0\fR and \fI1.0\fR to define the dullness and
brightness of the dimming effect on unfocused clients respectively.  (Default:
\fI0.5\fR)
.IP \fBWLC_DEBUG\fR

Possible values are \fI1\fR, \fIclient\fR, \fIserver\fR.
.IP \fBXKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT\fR
This corresponds to the layout you might use in X11 such as \fBgb\fR.  Use this
if you want to select a non-us keyboard layout.
.IP \fBXKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS\fR
Sets the keyboard options. The syntax is the same (comma-separated values) as
within an \fIxorg.conf\fR or when used via \%\fBsetxkbmap -option\fR.
For example \%\fBcompose:ralt,ctrl:nocaps\fR would set \fIralt\fR to the
compose key and cause the \fICaps Lock\fR key to mimic \fIctrl\fR.
